# New York Times Mock-up

Garett Tok, 2019

Hosted at: https://walnutdust.github.io/new-york-times/

This project was to create a mockup of ![New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html) using HTML/CSS.

## Languages
HTML/CSS

## Screenshots

Unfortunately, screenshots of how the original NYT looked at that time were not captured, but presented below are obtained from the ![Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), although from a slightly different time, and with certain functionalities not working. As such, there will be small discrepancies between the mockup and the site shown.
