    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist
      named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
      stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
      world of known physics.
      <br /><br />
      He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
      should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have
      made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course
      of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
      exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
      of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
      <br /><br />
      If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens
      look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The
      enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
      Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection,
      like spit in the ocean.
      <br /><br />
      “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and
      drew a double box around it.
      <br /><br />
      On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that
      they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
      known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
      <br /><br />
      Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to
      <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYc9YmKIO8&amp;feature=youtu.be">
      the first sliver of cosmic
      time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by
      John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
      ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
      <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html">
      gravitational waves</a> — the
      signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly
      a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
      long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
      colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
      <br /><br />
      Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
      including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
      <br /><br />
      If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
      comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe
      apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
      space and energy to science and speculation.
      <br /><br />
      Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14
       billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies,
       is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
       architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe
       there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy
       eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
       <br /><br />
      <strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong>
      <br /><br />
      In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating
      at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and
      ield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the
      first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
      Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
      <br /><br />
      Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert
      who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
      <br /><br />
      He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending
      a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
      <br /><br />
      The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of
      microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the
      universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
      <br /><br />
      Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep,
      for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their
      results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on
      Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

      <h1>The Theory of Inflation</h1>
      <h2>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,

          <p><strong>THE UNIVERSE&nbsp;</strong> is just under 14 billion years old.
          From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere
          that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a
          mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>
        </div>
        <div id= "toi-element">
          <p><strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME&nbsp;</strong> The universe is not old
            enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of
            the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for
            scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id= "toi-element">
          <p><strong>DISTANT COFFEE&nbsp;</strong>  At a smaller scale, imagine
            using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee
            cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature
            and how much it has cooled.</p>
        </div>
        <div id= "toi-element">
          <p><strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE&nbsp;</strong> Now turn around and look a
            mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly
            the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar
            cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id= "toi-element">
          <p><strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME&nbsp;</strong> There has not been
            enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get
            cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single
            coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even
            temperature.</p>
        </div>
        <div id= "toi-element">
          <p><strong>INFLATION&nbsp;</strong> solves this problem. The theory
            proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang,
            the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in
            the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the
            large-scale structures of the universe.</p>

        <div id= "toi-element">
          <p><strong>FLUCTUATION&nbsp;</strong> Astronomers have now detected
            evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light
            in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from
            the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by
            Einstein.</p>
        </div>
        <div id= "toi-element">
          <p><strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine a
            single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an
            even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation.
            And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the
            original pot.</p>

      Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in
      10 million.
      <br /><br />
      Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not
      expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
      <br /><br />
      “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
      <br /><br />
      The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of
      observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac
      personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr.
      Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as
      is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last
      week.
      <br /><br />
      “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,”
      said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio
      telescopes.
      <br /><br />
      Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most
      popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about
      to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford
      colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,
      <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlfIVEy_YOA">
      knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a> to tell him the news.

    <p>
      Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
      <br /><br />
      “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery
      but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that
      actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
      <br /><br />
      Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was
      still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling
      a vacation,” he said.
      <br /><br />
      By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation
      had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture
      of jubilation and caution.
      <br /><br />
      Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if
      this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the
      history of science.”
      <br /><br />
      John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and
      head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced
      himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very
      convincing,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that
      posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that
      if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed
      reservations about inflation.
      <br /><br />
      Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need
      for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates
      based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space
      Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
      <br /><br />
      “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss
      said.
      <br /><br />
      Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will
      report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying
      similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Spirals in the Sky</strong>
      <br /><br />
      Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the
      cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and
      Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
      <br /><br />
      Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves.
      He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of
      increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin,
      dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke
      of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of
      Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
      <br /><br />
      “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the
      ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering
      over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

      <figcaption>The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect
        the faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature <br \>of a universe being

      <br />
      In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation
      was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate
      in one direction rather than another.
      <br /><br />
      This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational
      waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and
      stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of
      polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the
      polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
      Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences
      in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is
      basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
      <br /><br />
      “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
      <br /><br />
      The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year
      burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things
      right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>A Special Time</strong>
      <br /><br />
      The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr.
      Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a
      special break point in the evolution of the universe.
      <br /><br />
      Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
      electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long
      suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single
      unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
      As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from
      grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with
      each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another
      splitting away.
      <br /><br />
      That was where Dr. Guth came in.
      <br /><br />
      Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
      temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point
      it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
      <br /><br />
      Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too
      long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious
      latent energy.
      <br /><br />
      Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind
      of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space
      itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the
      harder it pushed apart.
      <br /><br />
      What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a
      trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy
      to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
      <br /><br />
      Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
      particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead,
      resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions
      of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a
      free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate
      free lunch.”
      <br /><br />
      Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from
      Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is
      eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey
      expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off
      other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.
      So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not
      bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
      <br /><br />
      We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning,
      because inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and
      randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.
      “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian
      astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
